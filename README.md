#Brain Burst

A Turn-based game server in Node.js

---

**Still Under Development, please use `Under_Dev` branch until a usable version came out**
---

##Installation

Because `websocket` may need local extension, so please run `npm install` or `npm install websocket` to compile this.

**Updated:** If there is some strange problem, please `rm -rf node_modules` and then run `npm install` under project folder.

##Configuration

The configuration file is `configuration.js`, when doing local debug, please use `NODE_ENV=development` environment, otherwise use `NODE_ENV=depolyment`
